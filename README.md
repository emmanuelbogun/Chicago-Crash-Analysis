# Chicago-Crash-Analysis
For this project we will use a dataset with a combined nearly 1.5 million records, which represent traffic crashes reported in Chicago from 2013 to 2021 and the vehicles involved in them. The dataset was created in February 2021 and contains data sourced from the City of Chicago.
