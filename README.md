# Chicago-Crash-Analysis
For this project we will use a dataset with a combined nearly 1.5 million records, which represent traffic crashes reported in Chicago from 2013 to 2021 and the vehicles involved in them. The dataset was created in February 2021 and contains data sourced from the City of Chicago.

Please perform the following tasks in Python using the crashes.csv and crashes_vehicles.csv dataset:
Read the CSV files containing the Chicago traffic crash data. Identify the column common to both files and merge them together on that column. Then display the total number of reported crashes.
Change the ‘CRASH_DATE’ column to a date format. Drop observations that did not occur in 2018, 2019 or 2020 (other years have incomplete data).
Display a plot showing the number of crashes that occur for each hour of the day.
Name the make of vehicle that was involved in the most daylight crashes in August 2018. Remember that a crash can involve multiple vehicles.
Determine which weather condition was most prevalent for each type of crash.
Plot the primary contributing cause of reported crashes, from highest to lowest.
Display the 10 state license plates involved in the most crashes. Remember that a crash can involve multiple vehicles.
